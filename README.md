# IPL Score Predictor

## This project aims to predict the final score of a team in IPL using the current score and overs of a team

## Usage:
After cloning the repository to your local machine:

	•	Run the ScorePrediction-ModelSelection.ipynb file to create the predictive model. This process includes hyperparameter tuning and may take a few minutes.
	•	Execute ScorePredictor.ipynb to use a Tkinter GUI for user input and view predictions.

“Note: Due to size limitations on GitHub, the trained score predictor model (score_predictor.pkl) could not be uploaded to this repository. However, a scaler model necessary for data preprocessing is available.”
